Lite Shell is a simple shell that allows executing simple commands.

** Installation **

1) unizip the project.
2) run make.
3) open ~/.bash_profile and export the global variable LITE_SHELL_PATH
   e.g: vi ~/.bash_profile
	then append to the text: 
	  export LITE_SHELL_PATH="DirectoryWhereTheShellIsInstalled/bin"
	for example if you installed the shell in Desktop, then command will be
	  export LITE_SHELL_PATH="$HOME/Desktop/bin"
	or if you are inside the installation directory
	  export LITE_SHELL_PATH="$PWD/bin"
	save and quit.
	then run 
	  profile ~/.bash_profile
	this will set LITE_SHELL_PATH.
	
	Note: test by running echo $LITE_SHELL_PATH it should display the path to the bin
	installation directory after make was run.
